They are not venomous, but have a remarkably powerful bite. Often hunting at night, they have poor eyesight and navigate mostly by use of a pair of pedipalps. They are solitary creatures, coming together only to mate, the male using his pedipalps to transfer seminal fluid to the female, which buries between 50 and 200 eggs in the ground. The female stays with the young until they are mature enough to hunt and defend themselves, feeding and caring for them. Species of the genus Eremobates are generally found in the western United States, and at northern end into southwestern Canada, and south into Mexico.',

    description: 'Artemia is a genus of aquatic crustaceans also known as brine shrimp or sea monkeys. It is the only genus in the family Artemiidae. The first historical record of the existence of Artemia dates back to the first half of the 10th century from Lake Urmia, Iran, with an example called by an Iranian geographer an "aquatic dog" although the first documented unambiguous record is the report and drawings made by Schlösser in 1757 of animals from Lymington, England. Artemia populations are found worldwide, typically in inland saltwater lakes, but occasionally in oceans. Artemia are able to avoid cohabiting with most types of predators, such as fish, by their ability to live in waters of very high salinity (up to 25%). The ability of the Artemia to produce dormant eggs, known as cysts, has led to extensive use of Artemia in aquaculture. The cysts may be stored indefinitely and hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for larval fish and crustaceans. Nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia constitute the most widely used food item, and over 2,000 metric tons (2,200 short tons) of dry Artemia cysts are marketed worldwide annually with most of the cysts being harvested from the Great Salt Lake in Utah. In addition, the resilience of Artemia makes them ideal animals for running biological toxicity assays and it has become a model organism used to test the toxicity of chemicals. Breeds of Artemia are sold as novelty gifts under the marketing name Sea-Monkeys.',

They share similar characteristics and some species have been moved from one genus to the other and back again. Their larvae are predatory and feed on aphids and members of this genus have been used in biological pest control. William Elford Leach first described this genus in 1815 in Brewster\'s Edinburgh Encyclopædia. Albert Koebele introduced species of Chrysopa to New Zealand in the 1890s, as a method to combat aphids, however no Chrysopa species were able to establish.',

They are considered to be among the more derived of thrips, having evolved many traits key to specializing as cryptophilous phytovores, living in the narrow spaces at the bases of leaves and within flowers. Several species are economically significant pests, some of them invasive. Almost all of them are typical thrips which belong in the largest subfamily, the Thripinae.',

Similar species distributions exist and have separate migration patterns for other butterflies with the same geographical ranges.  Western monarchs, for example, migrate between southern BC, coastal CA and Pacific Mexico. Eastern monarchs can be found east of the Rockies in Canada and migrate along the Eastern American coast into interior Mexican highlands. The mountain ranges are often physical borders between distinct populations and migration. (Danaus plexippus)',

    description: 'Agrotis ipsilon, the dark sword-grass, ipsilon dart, black cutworm, greasy cutworm or floodplain cutworm, is a small noctuid moth found worldwide. The moth gets its scientific name from black markings on its forewings shaped like the letter "Y" or the Greek letter upsilon. The larvae are known as "cutworms" because they cut plants and other crops. The larvae are serious agricultural pests and feed on nearly all varieties of vegetables and many important grains. This species is a seasonal migrant that travels north in the spring and south in the fall to escape extreme temperatures in the summer and winter. The migration patterns reflect how reproduction occurs in the spring and ceases in the fall. Females release sex pheromones to attract males for mating. Pheromone production and release in females and pheromone responsiveness in males is dependent on the juvenile hormone (JH) and pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (BPAN). In the span of 2 months, the moth progresses through the life cycle stages egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. Throughout this time period, this moth faces the risk of predation and parasitism, such as by Hexamermis arvalis or by the parasite Archytas cirphis.',

    description: 'The army cutworm is the immature form of Euxoa auxiliaris. Together with other moths that are locally abundant and that have scales that dislodge from the wings, the adult moth is called a miller moth. These native North American larvae consume emerging small grains, alfalfa, and canola in the Great Plains and southern Canada. On dry, low elevation rangelands of the U.S. Intermountain West, army cutworms consume exotic cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and mustards to produce cheatgrass "die-offs." Within these bare areas, the larvae also defoliate native shrubs including four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) and sagebrush (Artemisia spp.). Army cutworms have only one generation per year. Adult moths lay eggs in the fall at low elevations in the Great Plains and U.S. Intermountain West. Larvae hatch in late fall and feed, mostly at night, through the winter and into spring. The larvae pupate in the soil in late spring and emerge as adult miller moths. The moths soon migrate to high elevations for the summer. Miller moths are a seasonal nuisance during their seasonal migrations through states including Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Kansas. Moths that emerge in the Great Plains migrate to high elevations in the northern Rocky Mountains, where they are an important food for grizzly bears. Moths that emerge in the Intermountain West migrate to nearby mountain ranges, such as the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico and the mountains of Great Basin National Park in eastern Nevada, where a 2014 Lepidoptera BioBlitz found "blizzard of adult army worm moths (Euxoa auxilliaris), which were present in millions." Miller moths return to low elevations as the weather cools in fall, but in smaller numbers. Although many consider the moths to be a nuisance, the insects pollinate plants and are food for bats.',

    description: 'Asterocampa celtis, the hackberry emperor, is a North American butterfly that belongs to the brushfooted butterfly family, Nymphalidae. It gets its name from the hackberry tree (Celtis occidentalis and others in the genus Celtis) upon which it lays its eggs. The hackberry tree is the only host plant for A. celtis and is the food source for larvae. The hackberry emperor is known for being a quick, mercurial butterfly. It often is found along water sources and lowlands, although it lives in a broad range of habitats. Another notable characteristic is that it rarely is spotted visiting a flower, which is considered unusual for a butterfly. Species in the genus Asterocampa are regarded as being "cheater" organisms, since these butterflies do not pollinate flowers when they feed from them. This species can more accurately be described as parasitizing their hosts and plant food sources since they extract nutrients without providing any benefits to the host. As a member of the family Nymphalidae, the hackberry emperor oviposits its eggs in clutches, or clusters, upon hackberry leaves. There are a few plausible evolutionary reasons for this behavior, but the exact cause for this species\' behavior is in contention. Possible explanations include higher fecundity that may be aided by aposematic coloration.',

This butterfly is black with iridescent-blue hindwings. They are found in many different habitats, but are most commonly found in forests. Caterpillars are often black or red, and feed on compatible plants of the genus Aristolochia. They are known for sequestering acids from the plants they feed on in order to defend themselves from predators by being poisonous when consumed. The adults feed on the nectar of a variety of flowers. Some species of Aristolochia are toxic to the larvae, typically tropical varieties. While enthusiasts have led citizen efforts to conserve pipevine swallowtails in their neighborhoods on the West coast, the butterfly has not been the subject of a formal program in conservation or protected in legislation. The butterfly is however of "Special Concern" in Michigan, which is on the Northern limit of its range. ',

Its common name comes from its preferred host plants and distinctive crawling behavior. Cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage, bok choy, and broccoli, are its main host plant; hence, the reference to cabbage in its common name. The larva is called a looper because it arches its back into a loop when it crawls. While crucifers are preferred, over 160 plants can serve as hosts for the cabbage looper larvae. The adult cabbage looper is a migratory moth that can be found across North America and Eurasia, as far south as Florida and as far north as British Columbia. Its migratory behavior and wide range of host plants contribute to its broad distribution. The cabbage looper larva is a minor vegetable pest, especially for crucifers. While it is not significantly destructive, it is becoming difficult to manage due to its broad distribution and resistance to many insecticides. Numerous methods are being researched in order to control this species. ',
